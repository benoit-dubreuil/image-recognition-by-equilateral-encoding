### Disclaimer

This project's purpose was only to practice and learn the equilateral encoding normalization technique.

### Goal

At the end of the normalization chapter of the book [Artificial Intelligence for Humans, Volume 1: Fundamental Algorithms](https://www.heatonresearch.com/aifh/vol1/) by [Jeff Heaton](https://www.heatonresearch.com/about/), it wsa suggested that the equilateral encoding algorithm could be using in image recognition algorithms, although it was intended for normalization for neural networks. Even though this algorithm is not the one that gives the best comparison results and that it is overcomplicated for what it does without neural networks, I just wanted to learn how to use it and thus I programmed this application. In other words, I made this repository to learn how to code and use the equilateral encoding algorithm.
